I'm gonna write about some small tools I use on a daily basis. Some of them are old, some of them are new and some of them are just for fun and for sure i need to remember in the future so here they are.

<hr>

I'll divide all the tools into some categories i may add or delete some of them later.

## CLI Tools

# [Harlequin](https://harlequin.sh/)
As a data scientist I need a SQL client every day. this tool stays in my terminal and it's basic it's simple and doing everything i need.

# [Yazi](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi)
This is a fast file manager for windows. Instead of doing every singe operation through the mouse, this tool helps me to my idea to just using keyboard.
