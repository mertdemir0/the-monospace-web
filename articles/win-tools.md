I'm gonna write about some small tools I use on a daily basis. Some of them are old, some of them are new and some of them are just for fun and for sure i need to remember in the future so here they are.

<hr>

I'll divide all the tools into some categories i may add or delete some of them later.

## CLI Tools
<hr>

### [Harlequin](https://harlequin.sh/)
As a data scientist I need a SQL client every day. this tool stays in my terminal and it's basic it's simple and doing everything i need.

### [Yazi](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi)
This is a fast file manager for windows. Instead of doing every singe operation through the mouse, this tool helps me to my idea to just using keyboard.

### Anaconda (not anymore)

I stopped using anaconda/conda environment tools because it just too slow instead of these i'm using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)

### [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
uv is a fast and lightweight build tool for [Python](https://www.python.org/) and it just works amazing. In these days we started to see in a lot of platforms and a lot of integrations.

it's just so easy to use and configure. In your terminal just pop __uv venv__ and it's ready to use that's all. no weird configuration. written in rust which means fast af.

<hr>

### VSCode

### Windsurf

### Cursor

### GitKraken

###  Windows Terminal

## Mail, Tasks, Calendar
<hr>

### Spark 

### Betterbird


## Browser
<hr>

### [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) ??? not anymore

### [Brave](https://brave.com)

### [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/)
I tried a lot of browsers before I gave up on them. Vivaldi is just amazing. i started to use vivaldi when it was on beta and used for a while but it was just too slow and heavy on system. after a lot of years passed i tried a lot of new browsers, started with chrome, passed to a firefox, then to opera, then to brave and finally to vivaldi.
