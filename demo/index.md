## About the Author
I create this website with the help of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [JODM](https://jodm.org/), and [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).
Idea behind this project is, releasing my distracted mind to the structured content.

On this page, you can find various examples of what you can do with __JODM__. I hope you find it useful.
